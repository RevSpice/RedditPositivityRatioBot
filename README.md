# RedditPositivityRatioBot


This is a project that takes a sample of the newests post of a particular subreddit, then finds keywords that are either positive or negative. Then it divides the two to create a ratio.

As this is a personal bot, if one were to use this project they would have to set up their own reddit bot. However, once that is accomplished, they can simply use the code needed.
